# JupyterLite Oceanographic and River Analysis Lessons

✨ An introduction to geophysical data analysis in Python ✨


## Lesson 1:
This lesson serves as an introduction to geophysical data analysis in Python. Follow a written tutorial to create your own Python Notebook in JupyterLite. Learn how to access publicly available river gage data from the [US Geological Survey](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) and use Python to open, plot, and analyze the data. Perform simple timeseries and statistical analyses of river gage height from the Taku River near Juneau, Alaska.


## Lesson 2:

This lesson serves as an intermediate geophysical data analysis in Python, offering more advanced data analysis tasks than those in Lesson 1 to demonstrate the capatibilities of Python. Directly interact with a pre-coded JupyterLite tutorial to analyze oceanographic conditions in the Southeast Bering Sea after downloading buoy data from the National Data [Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/).
